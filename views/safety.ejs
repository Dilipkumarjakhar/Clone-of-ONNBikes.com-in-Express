        <h3>Advantages for using two <br />wheeler for safety and health</h3>
        <div class="red-notice"></div>
        <p>
          With safety being the top priority for every individual, it gets
          riskier to use public <br />
          transport at the moment with so many concerns regarding the hygiene
          and <br />
          safety of such transportation. At the same time social distancing is
          becoming <br />
          our number one practise which makes it even more difficult to use any
          kind of <br />
          transport. Two wheelers being the most safest for commuting at this
          point, ONN <br />
          Bikes is taking every measure to make two wheelers available to the
          public in a <br />
          safe manner.
